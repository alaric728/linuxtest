1. Write my program, probably in python, keeping it simple.
2. Test program on variety of inputs and make sure it's behaving (letters instead of numbers, unrecognized options, etc.)
3. Pull down the upstream (? may not be needed for an apt package, consult the debian/apt docs)
4. Write the info for copyright, compat, rules etc. (Make sure destination follows the rules)
5. Test the build on my certified* fresh debian install, and then test it again on an actual fresh debian install
6. Add extra functionality if time allows, maybe some cool colors or text art or something?
